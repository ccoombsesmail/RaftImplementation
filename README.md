# RaftImplementation

This is my raft implementation from lab 2 of MIT course 6.824 (distributed systems). My code can be found in raft.go and util. 

To see test cases, run:
- go test -run 2A
- go test -run 2B
- go test -run 2C

As I do not get a certificate to show the completion of the course, I am keeping some of my labs on github for potential employers and/or interested parties. Please don't look at this if you are taking 6.824
